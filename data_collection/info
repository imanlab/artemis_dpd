Before using these two scripts you need to connect to the robots and sensors.

Use ROS and the guide for the sensor and lib_fanka for the robot. 

Sensor_visualisation.py is used to display the sensor output in 3 graphs.
Teleop_pointCloud2.py is used for teleoperation control between two robots with force feedback. In addition, a vector with robot information and sensor output is saved. You need also a vector with the point cloud of the object saved (PointCloudVector.npy).
