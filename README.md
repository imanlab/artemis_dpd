X, Y and Z are script used to train the network.
Run one model at time and saved the network.
Then use tracking to simulate an online prediction.

## About The Project
Early cancer detection is of utmost importance as it can allow faster, simpler and more effective treatment, hence saving many lives. Breast self-examination, expert palpation and Mammography are currently the means of detecting breast cancer. Expert and Self-examination are composed of a visual inspection of the breasts and palpation of the breasts and lymph nodes. Nonetheless, these are subjective approaches and may result in many false negative. On the other hand, in mammography, the body is exposed to radiation.

Hence, early breast cancer detection is not well practised illustrating a technology gap. Robot palpation is a solution to fill this gap. For example, during robotic minimally invasive surgery, palpation is essential to identify anomalies. Nowadays, the palpation action for breast cancer detection is performed by the patient, consequently of the subjects, the diagnosis is not always reliable, or by expert which is not convenient for many subjects, revealing an autonomous robot for palpation an interesting solution.

This project is on motion/Path planning from demonstrations](https://github.com/imanlab/artemis_dpd) -- developed by [Marta Crivellari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-crivellari-11231b1ba/?originalSubdomain=it) on a phantom silicon model.
